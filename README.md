# Employee-ManagementApplication API
This is my first project for the QA DFEW4 cohort. This project shall display both Frontend/Backend Software development. Additionally it shall produce Unit, System and User Testing.
Coverage at 91% for Junit and Integration testing
Employee Management Application Task- Attempted by Chibueze Ogu.
This application is designed to manage employee database, therefore it has a consistent CRUD functionality. A user is designed to log in into the database and then update and create their information within a local database (H2 has been enabled via the pom.xl file in this instance ). This information is relayed from the initial Java/SpringBoot code within the java .jar file provided. It then links to a main port within your system (port 8080 was used extensively during this project, but you can change this is so desired to a more compatible port). The Frontend contains fetches which catches the API links and enables the cross of hands between the front-end and backend. This project has full CRUD functionality within the Java and Spring aspect.
Getting Started
These instructions will enable you a cloned copy of the project, which will be up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Using the maven-wrapper.jar file that is provided in this repo will start create a connection to the localhost:8080 server. From here connect to the front end using the html files provided with the Front-End folder.
Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:
Backend Software:
Java 17 was used for creation
Use of an IDE Eclipse or InteliJ is recommended though others such IDEs as Visual Stuido Code can be used though be wary. IntelliJ IDE was used for creation.
MySQL Workbench was used for creation
For FrontEnd: HTML 5 Java 17
Tools Used
Eclipse Maven Jira (Agile Project management -) JUnit Mockito Postman Java Microsoft Excel (Risk Matrix).
Installing
To Install, clone the project your local Desktop or PC and save in a Git/Github folder. Using an IDE open the File Column and select Open Project From File System and select the file from whichever folder you have saved the project on.
Running the tests
To be able to test within the EMS file navigate to the control directory and run a mvn package on the file to push any tests through the command. To manually test within ItelliJ, right click on the ProjectApplication project file and select run Coverage As, as a JUnit Test. 
Unit Tests
The unit tests that are within the file are essentially testing that every and all method/constructors within classes I have been able to pass the tests with at least 90% coverage. To test or add any Unit Tests, ensure that you add files within the test file and within a corresponding file.
